# ZoraMint

Made this before Zora released their [ZoraOS](https://zora.engineering/protocol/smart-contracts) along with their docs on how things worked

Mints a new NFT on the Zora Protocol.

* I read through zora transactions and discovered they were using ipfs
* I went through the account on rinkeby and found that the account they publshed on mainnet was the same they used on rinkeby
* I found the contracts verified and took the abi which allowed me to decode the existing transactions to see how the Media.sol contract worked
